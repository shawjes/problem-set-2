Problem Set 2
Q1: Use BEDtools intersect to identify the size of the largest overlap between CTCF and H3K4me3 locations.
answer_1=bedtools intersect -a encode.tfbs.chr22.bed -b encode.h3k4me3.hela.chr22.bed -wo | awk 'BEGIN {FS=t; OFS=t} (==CTCF){print answers.sh}' | sort -k15nr | head -1 | cut -f 15
answer-1: 
The size of the largest overlap between CTCF and H3K4me3 locations is 1079.
5_pct_gc
0.384000
answer-2: 
Q3: Use BEDtools to identify the length of the CTCF ChIP-seq peak (i.e., interval) that has the largest mean signal in ctcf.hela.chr22.bg.gz.
answer-3: 
Q4: Use BEDtools to identify the gene promoter (defined as 1000 bp upstream of a TSS) with the highest median signal in ctcf.hela.chr22.bg.gz. Report the gene name (e.g., 'ABC123')
answer-4: 
Q5: Use BEDtools to identify the longest interval on chr22 that is not covered by genes.hg19.bed.gz. Report the interval like chr1:100-500.
answer-5: 
Q6: Use one or more BEDtools that we haven't covered in class. Be creative.
